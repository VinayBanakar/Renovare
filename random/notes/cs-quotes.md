1. The difference between following a recipe and understanding cooking: Recipe gives a set of rubrics to make a loaf of bread and to make it that is all you need but the problem with it is recipes have limited scope (can't cook omelet with bread recipe) but if you have a deep understanding of cooking (ex: thermodynamics (bake), biology (yeast) there is a different way of viewing everything (opens possibilities to make sandwich, breads, whatever you want). Following large set of recipes might solve a problem but when you don't find what you want one day, what do you do? Not everyone requires deep understanding (nothing gets done) but if you don't when you need you'll do the wrong thing. - Jim Keller
2. Don't be fooled by the many books on complexity or by the many complex and arcane algorithms you find in this book or elsewhere. Although there are no textbooks on simplicity, simple systems work and complex don't. - Jim Gray
3. AI is/can evolve in a non genetic manner, removing the need of intelligent beings reproducing more in order to evolve human intelligence/brains. -Richard Dawkins
