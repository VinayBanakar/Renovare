Key observations, insights/critiques and learnings  

So first read the entire paper and get an idea, rather than jumping to read other relevant papers. Just make a note on the side for now. After reading it once or twice you start writing the review. First off, summarize the paper. Next, state what you think the contributions are (think hard). Now start with any specific comments (perhaps look out for typos/grammar too, but point them in separate section like “Nits:”). In specific comments talk about novelty (any related work? Will that emphasize or degrade this paper), any technical flaws you think there are? (don’t assert), any gaps or unaddressed issues? Finally conclude with your thoughts. Exhibit caution in the tone you write the review. Don’t forget that you might have misunderstood the paper or parts of it. Hence, don’t make flat assertions but rather express your thoughts on your understanding of the flawed theory from its description.
